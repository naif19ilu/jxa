    Jxa - Java executable arguments parser

    This is a lightweight argument parser for Java programs, it
    is inspired in the 'getopt' header found in glibc.

    It allows the programmer to define flags their programs
    may need by assigning a full-name, id, either it requires
    arguments, if it does not or if it is optional, also allows
    the programmer to set default values to the flags and jxa
    also offers a simple way to display the whole program's usage
    (see JxaDoc class)

    --flag <argument>      long option with separate argument
    --flag=argument        long option with attached argument
    -f argument            short option with argument
    -abc                   grouped short options
    --                     end of flag parsing (everything after is positional)

    For better understanding please see 'Tester.java' and play around
    with it :)
